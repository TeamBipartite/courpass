**Please note that this project is no longer operational in its current state,
as the underlying UVic webpages it relied on have since been deprecated.**

# Prerequisites
You will need a Python environment with the packages as specified in the
`requirements.txt` file installed. Creating a `venv` to manage this environment
is recommended, but not necessary.

# Run
## Django webserver
To launch the Django server for local development, navigate to the `academic_calendar_scraper/academic_calendar_scraper` directory. From there, you can run the following command:
```
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

The above command will output some status information. You will likely see a message regarding "18 unapplied migration(s)," as mentioned in the docs [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/); they can be ignored at this time.

You will find the server running [here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/); note, the local development url is also given as part of the above command's output.

## Command-line usage

Within the root directory, there is a main.py file which can be used to generate a text-based prerequisite grid. Basic usage is as follows:

```bash
$ python3 -O main.py <LIST_OF_COURSES_TO_SEARCH> <LIST_OF_PREREQS_TO_FIND>
```
where `LIST_OF_COURSES_TO_SEARCH` and `LIST_OF_PREREQS_TO_FIND` are comma-separated lists. For example:

```bash
$ python3 -O main.py CSC360,CSC361,CSC370,CSC421,MATH100,MATH346 CSC226,SENG265,CSC230,ECE255,MATH120,MATH204,MATH200
